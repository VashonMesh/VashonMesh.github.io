# Second Meeting

Michael Meyer and Jeff Few have reserved Penny Farcy (on the Vashon Fire campus) and Vashon Library's meeting room for our next gathering Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:30-5:30.

At the 1st meeting there was broad interest to actually experiment and try out various devices people had or were curious about. There were many knowledgeable folks and a few who had devices but hadn't done much with them.

Anyone is free to come to the meeting, with or without devices. If you just bring a smartphone we may be able to get you online!

## Agenda

Nothing formal but maybe hit the following points

- Introductions & interests
- Anyone need to flash their device? (side group if so)
- Everyone able to communicate on the public channel?
- Try 10 messages "at once", or other stress tests?
- Try Table topping a test situation: loose zebras in Jensen Point park, or?
