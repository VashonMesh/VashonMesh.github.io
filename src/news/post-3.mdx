The new LilyGo P4 radio might be the future of Meshtastic devices and -
eventually - MeshCore.

Check out this demo video showing how user-friendly it is:

It also sounded like the software for Meshtastic is still being worked on, and I
doubt the MeshCore software has this level of user interface support yet. Anyone
know about sophisticated user interfaces for Meshtastic or MeshCore?
