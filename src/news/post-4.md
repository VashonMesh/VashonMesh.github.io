Michael Meyer and Jeff Few have reserved Penny Farcy (on the Vashon Fire campus) and Vashon Library's meeting room for our next gathering **Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:30-5:30pm**.

At the 1st meeting there was broad interest to actually experiment and try out various devices people had or were curious about. There were many knowledgeable folks and a few who had devices but hadn't done much with them.

Anyone is free to come to the meeting, with or without devices. If you just bring a smartphone we may be able to get you online!

## Agenda items sought

We don't need anything formal, but a default structure to start with may help guide the meeting.

- Introductions & interests
- Anyone need to flash their device? (side group if so)
- Everyone able to communicate on the public channel?
- Add the **#vashon** channel to our devices & test that
- Try 10 messages "at once", or other stress tests?
- Discuss Emergency Communication more? Use cases, public & private channel names, monitoring
- Try Table topping (Talk thru what we'd do, without taking time to actually do it) a test situation: "loose zebras in Jensen Point park", or "island internet down for a few days"?
- What else???

We're in two separate locations: Maybe have one more for discussion and the other more for hands on help with device issues?

Jeff & I want this to be productive & address any needs. Let us know by by responding to this email blast, or contacting us directly.
