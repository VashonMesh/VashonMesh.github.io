- Components are reusable units of code for your HTML pages. These could be
  Astro components (https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), or UI
  framework components
  (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/) like React or
  Svelte. It is common to group and organize all of your project components
  together in this folder.

- This is a common convention in Astro projects, but it is not required. Feel
  free to organize your components however you like!
