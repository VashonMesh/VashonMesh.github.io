      <h1>Get an Antenna</h1>

      <p>
        When selecting an antenna, consider these factors:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Frequency Range:</strong> Ensure the antenna supports your region's
            LoRa frequency bands (for the US public).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use:</strong> Will you be using this at a fixed site, or does
            it need to be portable & rugged? Will it be indoors or outdoors. (Most
            are fully weatherproofed.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gain:</strong> Higher gain antennas can improve signal strength
            and range for fixed antennas. However they don't radiate up or down as
            well, so won't reach as effectively into valleys & hilltops or if not
            kept vertically aligned.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Type:</strong> Choose between omnidirectional (360-degree coverage)
            or directional (focused signal) antennas based on your needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connector Type:</strong> Verify compatibility with your SDR device
            (e.g., SMA, BNC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build Quality:</strong> Look for durable materials, especially
            for outdoor use. Others have characterized many antennas on the internet
            as being of inferior quality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Proper placement and orientation of the antenna can significantly
          impact reception quality. While LoRa signals can through some trees
          and other obstructions, less is definitely better. Mount your antenna
          as high as you can get it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider disconnecting external antennas when lightening storms
          threaten.

          As rated by Andy Kirby, at
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQAsYs12y8, here are some recommended
          antennas for receiving HD Radio signals:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bad:</strong>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Good:</strong>
              <img src="/site-imgs/Antenna-Good.png" alt="Good Antenna" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Great:</strong>
              <img src="/site-imgs/Antenna-Great.png" alt="Great Antenna" />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          SeeedStudio resells antennas from RF Explorer, indicating their
          approval. These are not petite, so shipping prices can be high. Here
          are two options:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>5.8dBi gain</strong>
