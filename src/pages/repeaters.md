use case, and what we refer to here as a fixed repeater: something with
batteries or solar panels for multi-day power, weather-proofed, and often fewer
UI elements.

  All in one. Sounds like it's well supported and well regarded. This is going
  to be my "plug and play" repeater for travel and events.

- [WisBlock Meshtastic Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/RAKwireless-WisBlock-Meshtastic-Starter-RAK19007/dp/B0CHKZJK9C/)
  & RAK Wireless Solar Unify Enclosure Case: This is going to be my experimental
  repeater for trying out code changes.
