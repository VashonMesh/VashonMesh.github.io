            Puget Mesh created a channel on their discord server for us:
            #vashon-maury-island-amateur-radio-club https://discord.gg/53NqpuyP
            I've also asked them to create a chennel for just location, not
            specific to club. I the meantime I guess we're just zpart of King
            County.

            There's an emcomm channel that might also be of interest:
            https://discord.gg/gksNQnpC it looks like there is a lot of activity
            there and might be a good place to take out questions?
          </p>

          <p>
            I plan on hanging out in the MeshCore dev (#dev-mc) channel
            https://discord.gg/JkGHEkuQ
