**Mesh Networking**

(This is a very early cut. Others are **encouraged** to jump in and edit freely to correct mistakes, make things clearer, etc!)

**Intro**

Vashon folks are interested to cooperatively learn about the relatively new Lora technology. Incentives range from education, playing with fun gadgets, long distance communication with sensors, and especially Emergency Communications: EMCOMM.

**Technology Options**

- **Lora** - The base technology allowing long range, low bandwidth communications.
- **PTP** - Point to point: two devices can talk to one another simply
- **LoraWan** - Huge industry led solution for gathering sensor data into the cloud.
- **Mestastic** - Great for casual use among a few local users
- **MeshCore** - Great for community networks with fixed 'repeaters' and more traffic
- **AREDN** - Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network. This does NOT use Lora. "Instead The frequency ranges that are currently supported are the 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz bands. These microwave frequencies do require direct line of sight for reliable communication. Depending on the type of radios and antennas that are deployed, it’s possible to achieve network links anywhere from a few miles to well over 30 miles between sites." Included here as an alternative, or source of conventions/framework that maybe helpful. PugetMesh acknowledges them prominently on their site.

Vashon will start with MeshCore, but may adopt other technologies (in parallel) if there is desire.
