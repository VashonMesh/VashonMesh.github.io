## Welcome

VashonMesh is a small group of rebels helping others connect to MeshCore and
related local area mesh networks.

Astro website project for VashonMesh. Here's what was set up:

## Project Structure:

- package.json - Astro dependencies and build scripts
- astro.config.mjs - Astro configuration for GitHub Pages
- index.astro - Homepage with VashonMesh branding and content
- Layout.astro - Base layout template
- favicon.svg - Custom mesh network icon
- .gitignore - Updated to ignore build artifacts and dependencies

## Features:

- Modern, responsive design with gradient hero section
- Three content cards explaining VashonMesh and mesh networking
- Purple/blue color scheme
- Mobile-friendly layout
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds & deploys the site to https://vashonmesh.github.io/ when changes are published

## You can run locally (e.g., in Visual Studio Code) with:

'''npm run dev''' - Start dev server
'''npm run build''' - Build for production
