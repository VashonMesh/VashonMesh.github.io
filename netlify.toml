# Note: Removed vulnerable Netlify plugins (netlify-plugin-image-optim, 
# @netlify/plugin-lighthouse, netlify-plugin-checklinks, netlify-plugin-cache)
# 
# Alternatives:
# - Image optimization: Use Astro's built-in Image component or pre-optimize images
# - Lighthouse: Run locally or use Netlify Analytics
# - Link checking: Use build-time checks or GitHub Actions
# - Caching: Netlify automatically caches node_modules and build artifacts
